# Brain Cancer Machine Learning Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection and classification of brain cancer using medical imaging data. 
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting brain cancer, demonstrating the potential of AI in medical diagnostics.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build a reliable ML model to classify brain cancer from image data.
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Image preprocessing and augmentation  
  - Machine learning algorithms
  - Model evaluation and tuning

- **Results:**  
  - Highest prediction accuracy: **96.2%**  
  - Average accuracy across multiple runs: **93.6%+**
 

- ## Dataset
